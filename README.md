# Text-Classifcation-using-NLP
Text classification also known as *text tagging* or *text categorization* is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.

This kernel aims to give  a brief overview of performing text classification using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree Classifier. We will be using a dataset called "**Economic news article tone and relevance**" which consists of approximately 8000 news articles, which were tagged as ***relevant*** or ***not relevant*** to the US Economy. Our goal in this kernel is to explore the process of training and testing text classifiers for this dataset.
